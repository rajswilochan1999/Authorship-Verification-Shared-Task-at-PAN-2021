        "This baseline offers a naive, yet fast solution to the \n",
        "PAN2020 track on authorship verification. All documents\n",
        "are represented using a bag-of-character-ngrams model,\n",
        "that is TFIDF weighted. The cosine similarity between\n",
        "each document pair in the calibration data set is\n",
        "calculated. Finally, the resulting similarities are\n",
        "optimized, and projected through a simple rescaling\n",
        "operation, so that they can function as pseudo-probabi-\n",
        "lities, indiciating the likelihood that a document-pair\n",
        "is a same-author pair. Via a grid search, the optimal\n",
        "verification threshold is determined, taking into account\n",
        "that some difficult problems can be left unanswered.\n",
        "Through setting `num_iterations` to an integer > 0,\n",
        "a bootstrapped variant of this procedure can be used.\n",
        "In this case, the similarity calculation is applied in\n",
        "an iterative procedure to a randomly sampled subset of\n",
